# Common Driver Reconstruction

Figures and Codes for the "Reconstructing shared dynamics with a deep neural network" paper.

## Dataset
The data set can be found at data/sampledata.csv.

## Results

The results are generated by the ```gen_exampleResults.py``` script and saved to the ```scripts_and_results/resdata/``` folder.

The figures are generated by the ```gen_allfigures.py``` file and saved to the ```scripts_and_results/resfigure/``` folder. These figures also can be generated separately by the ```genfig_*.py``` scripts.

The ```Logistic_map.ipynb``` notebook contains some visualizations about the embedding of the forced logistic map system.

The ```data_view.ipynb``` notebook shows time series plots of the dataset.

The ```learning_curves.ipynb``` notebook contains some visualizations about the learning curves of the models.

## Installation on Ubuntu

1. Create a new virtual environment:

    ```
    $ conda create -n macoenv
    ```

    ```
    $ conda activate macoenv
    ```

2. Navigate to the folder and then install the dependencies:

    ```
    (macoenv)$ pip install -r ./requirements.txt
    ```

3. Then, for a test, run the ```./scripts_and_results/gen_allfigures.py``` !
